# Denver Open Source Remoters Club

**We're a group of Open Source contributors in the Denver area who work remotely and enjoy not going insane from a lack of human contact.** We meet up around Denver once a week at coffee shops, libraries, and other cool spaces to hang out with—and sometimes even get work done in the presence of—other Open Source peeps.

## Join Us

Anyone working in, working with, or interested in Open Source software is welcome to join and meed up with us. Just remember, there are two types of events:

- **Coworking**: this isn't a social hour, it's a time for us all to get work done while being around other Open
Source people. Of course before, after, and breaks are all great times to socialize and meet people!

- **Social**: no work expected! People are planning to just hang out—and inevitably nerd out—with one another. If it leads to work or work-adjacent conversations, so be it—but that's not the goal.

We plan to alternate between each every week. Come to whichever floats your boat!
