Denver Open Source Remoters Club website

> **Note**

## Building

I recommend using `toolbox` for development, especially if you're on Endless OS or Fedora Silverblue. See [Cassidy’s blog post][2] for details on how to get set up.

Once you're set up, build and serve locally with:

```shell
bundle exec jekyll serve --host 0.0.0.0
```

The site should now be available at http://0.0.0.0:4000/ on your local machine, and your local machine's IP address on your network—great for testing on mobile OSes.
